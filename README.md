ProjectB | The Visionary Launchpad

ProjectB is a strategic ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between creative visionaries and high-level technical producers. It serves as a specialized marketplace where raw gaming concepts are structured, protected, and eventually transformed into tangible products.

🚀 Core Philosophy

ProjectB operates as a conceptual incubator. We don't just host ideas; we provide the framework for their survival in a competitive market:

The Genesis: Creators submit raw concepts through a standardized submission workflow.

The Vault (Socrates Protocol): High-tier protection to ensure intellectual sovereignty.

The Market: Premium producers (Studios/Devs) browse the feed to find concepts worthy of instantiation.

🛡️ The Socrates Protocol: Creative Sovereignty

The cornerstone of the platform. The Socrates Protocol is designed to solve the "Idea Poaching" problem:

Ownership Locking: Ensures the original creator remains the sole decision-maker.

Strategic Shielding: Prevents unauthorized extraction of key conceptual mechanics by third parties.

Sovereignty: Provides the creator with full negotiating power when a Premium producer shows interest.

🛠️ Technical Architecture

Frontend (User Interface)

Aesthetic: Minimalist "Card & Glassmorphism" design (White cards on deep black backgrounds).

Styles: Modular CSS files (auth.css, landing.css) to ensure fast loading and easy maintenance.

Icons: Powered by Bootstrap Icons.

Logic & Security

Event Handling: Decoupled JavaScript logic (Zero inline scripts) to maintain a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).

State Management: Client-side session handling and secure API communication.

🌍 Roadmap

[ ] Phase 6: Secure Rights Negotiation Protocol.


Security Note:
The project is configured with helmet.js. Ensure that any external scripts (CDNs) are explicitly whitelisted in the CSP configuration within server.js.
